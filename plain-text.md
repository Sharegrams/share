ct: Look for hashtags that have much less posts in them — think something like 30k to 500k posts here, and also look what amount of likes they get.\nLooking into each tag is REQUIRED - don't be lazy.\nIf you thought the hashtag #joy would be good for you, because you have some beauty brand, but when you actually go there you discover that it's full of KPOP stars and doesn't really have anything to do with what you had intented at all.\n\nGOOD!\n\nYou now have a spot for a better hashtag to focus on.
